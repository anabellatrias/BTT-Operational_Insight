OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Tests passed: 0/4
Validation strength: WEAK

❌ Model shows weak business correlation


INTERPRETATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The model was trained on 5k labeled data and applied to 2k operational logs.
Despite different data sources and activity granularity, the model's predictions
show weak correlation with business metrics (cost, rework, SLA breaches).

This questions that the model has learned generalizable bottleneck patterns.


RECOMMENDATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ DO NOT DEPLOY: Investigate model limitations before production use
