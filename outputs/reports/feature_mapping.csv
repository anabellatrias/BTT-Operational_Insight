5k_column,2k_column,status,transformation,importance
case_id,case_id,✅ DIRECT MATCH,None,Identifier
event_num_in_case,event_nr,✅ DIRECT MATCH,Rename column,Identifier
activity_name,activity,⚠️ SIMILAR,Different granularity - 2k has more detailed activities,HIGH - needed for reference table lookup
is_bottleneck_event,MISSING,❌ TARGET,This is what we predict!,TARGET VARIABLE
duration_minutes,duration_sec,✅ CONVERTIBLE,duration_sec / 60,HIGH - 2.07x lift for bottlenecks
wait_time_minutes,wait_time_sec,✅ CONVERTIBLE,wait_time_sec / 60,HIGH - 1.65x lift for bottlenecks
expected_duration_minutes,CAN DERIVE,✅ CALCULABLE,Lookup from activity_reference table,CRITICAL - needed for variance calculation
variance_to_expected,CAN CALCULATE,✅ CALCULABLE,(duration_minutes - expected) / expected,CRITICAL - 10.02x lift! Most important feature!
queue_length_at_start,MISSING,❌ NEED PROXY,Count concurrent active cases at timestamp,"MEDIUM - 1.46x lift, can be proxied"
system_load_index_0to1,MISSING,❌ NEED PROXY,"Rolling avg of wait_time, normalized to 0-1","LOW - 1.18x lift (not significant), less critical"
handoff_count_so_far,CAN CALCULATE,✅ CALCULABLE,Count resource changes per case,"LOW - 0.97x (not predictive), but easy to calculate"
weekday,weekday,✅ DIRECT MATCH,None,MEDIUM - temporal patterns
hour_of_day,hour,✅ DIRECT MATCH,Rename column,MEDIUM - temporal patterns
start_timestamp_utc,timestamp,⚠️ PARTIAL,2k only has one timestamp (not start/end),MEDIUM - needed for time calculations
priority,priority,✅ DIRECT MATCH,May need to map values (Low/Medium/High),MEDIUM
sla_breached,sla_breach,✅ DIRECT MATCH,Check value encoding (0/1),MEDIUM
NONE,cost_usd,➕ BONUS,Use for business validation,HIGH - for validation (not training)
NONE,rework_flag,➕ BONUS,Use for business validation,HIGH - for validation (not training)
